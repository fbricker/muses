THIS IS A SAMPLE SKIN FILE FOR MUSES RADIO PLAYER
-------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------
ALMOST EVERY STUFF YOU MAY WANT TO CHANGE IS PLACED HERE. THE ONLY 
SKIN-RELATED-CONFIGURABLE-STUFF THAT IS NOT HERE, IS THE PLAYER WIDTH AND
HEIGHT (WHICH YOU MUST SET DIRECTLY IN THE HTML FILE IN THE OBJECT AND THE
EMBED SECTION OF YOUR FLASH CODE)

XML SECTIONS:
-------------
* MUSES-SKIN:
    This is the main section. Here you can set the folder where images will be
    found.
    Note that you can set relative or absolute paths (even remote hosts!)
* BG:
    Here you can set the background IMAGE for your player, and X,Y coords for
    your image.
* PLAY:
    You can set your play button X,Y coords, together with onMouseOver image
    (IMAGE) and onClick image (CLICKIMAGE)
    Note that you don't need to specify a normal status image, since that will
    be placed on the background image of the player (BG).
* STOP:
    Same that PLAY, but for stopping the sound :P
* TEXT:
    Here you can set X,Y coords and WIDTH, HEIGHT of your text status area.
    Also you can set text COLOR, FONT, SIZE and ALIGN.
    Note: The only embed font is Silkscreen, so you use that or choose a font
    that cames with OS like arial, verdana, etc.
	Note 2: The align property can be: center, left or right.
* VOLUME:
    Here you can set X,Y coords and WIDTH, HEIGHT of your volume control area.
    You can also choose between "bars" and "holder" MODE. Using mode="bars"
    or mode="holder".
    - BARS mode:
    	If you're using bars mode, you can set COLOR1 and COLOR2 (where color1
    	will be the active bars and color2 the un-active bars).
    	Also, you'll be able to set BARWIDTH (the width in pixels of each bar)ç
    	and BARSTEP (space between bars). Play with this to learn more :)
    - HOLDER mode:
    	In this mode, you'll need to configure HOLDERIMAGE attribute (this will
    	be a little image/bullet/somethingelse) that the user will grab and 
    	move to change volume.
    - VHOLDER mode (for vertical holder):
    	In this mode, you'll need to configure HOLDERIMAGE attribute (this will
    	be a little image/bullet/somethingelse) that the user will grab and 
    	move to change volume.
* STATUS:
	Here you can set status indication images. Uses IMAGEPLAY when the player
	is working, and IMAGESTOP when the player is stopped.
	As allways, you must set X,Y for status.
	Note that you can use this the way you want (IE: making an intication led,
	changing the play and stop buttons, or changing the backgound image/color).
	
SECTION ATTRIBUTES:
* IMAGE:
    You can use GIF, JPG and TRNSPARENT PNG files as images (maybe you can also
    use SWF files -must check).
    Valid values are STRINGS indicating a file name. IE: image="backg.jpg"
* X,Y:
    Used for object locations, their values means pixels from the left and top
    of the player.
    Valid values are INTEGER NUMBERS (greater or equals zero). Don't need the px
    in the end. IE: x="44"
* WIDTH,HEIGHT: (only for text areas and volume control areas)
    Used for indicating objects width and height, their values means pixels.
    Valid values are INTEGER NUMBERS (greater or equals zero). Don't need the px
    in the end. IE: width="120"
* COLOR:
    Used for indicating objects colors, their values means RGB HTML colors.
    Valid values are HTML 6 digits color (with or without a leading #).
    IE: color1="#fe4dd4"  color2="202020"
* BARWIDTH, BARSTEP;
	Explained in VOLUME section, their values means pixels.
    Valid values are INTEGER NUMBERS (greater or equals zero). Don't need the px
    in the end. IE: BARWIDTH="3" BARSTEP="6"
* MODE:
	Explained in VOLUME section, this value selects wich kind of volume control
	component the player will use.
	Possible values are: BARS and HOLDER.
	IE: mode="bars"
	IE: mode="holder"

TIPS AND ADVICES:
-----------------
Don't forget to use attribute="value" format (always with quotes). HAXE XML OBJECT REQUIRES THAT.
Check that the muses-skin tag is well closed (</muses-skin>) and that the opening and closing case (upper or lowercase) is the same. HAXE XML OBJECT REQUIRES THAT.
